1. Introduce yourself

2. Go simple language
- Designed by Rob Pike and Ken Thompson, 
  they like simplicity reflected in the design of UNIX
- Little more details why go is a simple language
- No generics 

3. Introduce your topic

code-generators two type I encountered so far
- Template Based
- Ast Based

Template generator
- converting a list of struct into a map

Reflection
- interface{} - pair ??
- Type, Value, Kind function
- json example
- advantage: simple code
- disadvantage: repetitive rework, can save CPU and memory by generating code

AST code-generator
- AST - go/ast
- //go:generate ---
- code walkthrough
- state that go has a benchmarking tool in built in the testing package 
  use -benchmem to look to memory allocations
- benchmarks

Code Generators @ shaadi
- Most code is generated, we only write business logic
- since code is generated, there can be no silly mistakes, 
  deploy with confidence
- benchmark

coding in C need to do manual memory mgmnt (complex at times... causes memory leaks...)
